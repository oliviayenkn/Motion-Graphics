            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Motion graphics is a kind of animation that focuses on providing motion to graphic design elements. It is a way of adding depth to design elements and to highlight the message, where graphic design can be seen more static. Motion graphics can help to provide a better user experience when for example entering the wrong password. Motion graphics dates back to around the 19th century where a German filmmaker, Walter Ruttman, was the first director to employ visualization techniques like motion graphics.

        <p>Any technique that makes static objects move is basically animation. Motion graphic separates from other kinds of animation because of its content which is setting graphic design (that being objects, text or other elements) in motion, where animation itself focuses more on a cinematic effect and storytelling.</p>

            <h2>SOFTWARE</h2>
            <p>After effects is a software programme that allows you to animate 2D. It is easy to use together with other Adobe programmes like Illustrator and Photoshop. This is great because you would normally use several programmes in order to make your motion graphic. A typical workflow could be to start designing your assets in illustrator, then importing them into After Effects and adding visual effects. After effects also has a lot of different plugins that makes the platform even more versatile.
